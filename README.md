# Server-Manager

Run the makefile with the 'make' command to compile the client and the server.

Run the server in one terminal windown and run the client in another (can handle multiple clients concurrently).

Follow instructions from client (Select a directory for the file to be transferred to then enter the file path of the file that is to be transferred).

Once the file path has been entered, close the client.

After this, the server will check whether or not the user logged in to the client has access to the directory. If the user has access, the transfer will be executed, and if not, the transfer will be aborted and an error message will be displayed
